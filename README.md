3-Dimensional Solar Orbit Grapher

This repository includes a python script that outputs the polar and cartesian corrdinates of a planet given its eccentricity, period, and major (or minor) axis. If you wish to plot the planet's orbit in 3-D, the incline and longitude of ascending of ascending node (in degrees or radians) is needed. For example, the input values for the python script create a graph for the Asteroid Abnoba 456 and a graph for the Earth.

In this repository, a matlab file is also included. Matlab was used to complete the final 3-D graphs. Note that the two rotating bodies (in this case the asteroid and the Earth) are rotating in proportion to their real rotational velocity.
